# clite
simplified C/C++ for shorthand or new users 

CLite is a collection of macros that allow for more verbose/legible C/C++ code.
It's meant for beginners or people that're too lazy to type certain things out manually. (i.e. "string g = "asdfasdfa"; in place of const char* characters = "sdafdaads"; ")

#Usage
Download the "clite.h" header file and link it to your project.
Include it ONLY AFTER EVERY OTHER FILE in any files in which you may wish to use it.
